# Odd Duck Product Co

### This is an application to help Odd Duck Product Co determine what their next product should be

* When a user visits the site they will be prompted to choose one of three random images
* When a user selects an image, all three images are replaced with three more randomly selected images
* To ensure that there is limited recurrence bias, there will never be a sequence of images that are shown consecutively
* When the user has voted 25 times total they will be able to view a chart that displays how many times each item was seen and/or voted for
* There is persistent memory so that the user can refresh the page and continue to gather compounding selection data
